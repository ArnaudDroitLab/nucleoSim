Title: Generate synthetic nucleosome maps
Description: This package can generate a synthetic map with reads
        covering the nucleosome regions as well as a synthetic map with
        forward and reverse reads emulating next-generation sequencing.
        The user has choice between three different distributions for
        the read positioning: Normal, Student and Uniform.
