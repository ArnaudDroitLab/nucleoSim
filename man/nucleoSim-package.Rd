\title{nucleoSim: Generate synthetic nucleosome maps}
\description{
This package can generate a synthetic map with
reads covering the nucleosome regions as well as a synthetic map with
forward and reverse reads emulating next-generation sequencing.
The user has choice between three different
distributions for the read positioning: Normal, Student and Uniform.
